=============

This is a quick and dirty Perl script that I wrote for an acquaintance to
scrape information about insurance agents registered with the Idaho Department
of Insurance. I make no promises about it being good, effective, and I
certainly don't promise that it won't blow anything up.

I don't maintain this.
